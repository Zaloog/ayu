- align result Icons better on test tree
- some form of test preview
- some form of result viewer
- search by name/tag functionality
- dynamic collaps/expand if all tests on a module are run and passed
- some more info on the module/dir path in tree e.g. 3/5 tests passed
- test tree filtering
- menu dynamic plugin installation+flags (needs uv)
- using something like watchfiles to detect filechanges and update the test_tree accordingly (or just stick with a manual refresh)
